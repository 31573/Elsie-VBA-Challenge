Historical ticker data


Below is a list of stock tickers and their daily historical data for years 2018, 2019, and 2020. The historical data includes the dates, the opening price, the highest and lowest price reached for each day, the closing price and the volume. Each year is on a separate tab.

The macro labelled “ run ticker” will populate the following to the right of the data

	1.	Make list of the unique ticker symbols
	2.	Bring in the opening price of each ticker on the first day of the year
	3.	Bring the closing price of each ticker on the last day of the year
	4.	Calculate the change in price between the open and close
	5.	Calculate the yearly change as a percentage
			a. It will highlight the amounts in green if the yearly change is above 0
			b. It will highlight the amounts in red if the yearly change is below 0
			c. It will not color cell if the yearly amount is 0
	6.	Total the volume for each stock
	7.	Bring the ticker that had the highest yearly change and the associated amount in percentage
	8.	Bring the ticker that had the lowest yearly change and the associated amount in percentage
	9.	Bring the ticker that had the highest volume and the associated amount.
	10.	It will repeat the above for every year and return to the 2018 tab.

The macro labelled ”clear” will clear the steps 1 -9 in each tab and return to 2018 tab.
